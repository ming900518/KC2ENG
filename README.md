This modified version allows players who do not use VPN to play Kantai Collection and use English as main language to use this app.

This project will not be used for profit, and according to the original author's requirements, no form of fee is allowed.

## How to install

#### [Click here to view the latest official version](https://github.com/ming900518/KC2ENG/releases/tag/Release2.2.1)
#### [Click here to join Cydia source](https://kc2tweaked.github.io/repo/)


#### Currently the latest official version is 1.0 (ENG-Release 2.2.1), I strongly recommend using the latest official version. (Updated: 2020/01/12)
#### Since I do not have an iOS 12 device to debug, and the program already supports iOS 13, if you encounter unexpected problems, please update iOS to the latest version.

Supports all iDevices above iOS 11.4 in theory (not supported by iPhone 5 and older 32-bit devices)

The source code may be different from the released version.

The original author has suspended the update plan of the program. The main version will remain at 1.0 until the original author releases the update. I will still work to fix the existing bugs. I also hope that the Swift programming experience can help to update the program.

#### As Apple has updated the signing requirements, please go to [Official Website](http://kc2tweaked.github.io) to see the latest installation method!

Jailbreak users can download through Cydia source.
